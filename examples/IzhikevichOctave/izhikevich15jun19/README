* 2003-2004 Models:

EM Izhikevich "Simple Model of Spiking Neurons" IEEE Transactions On
Neural Networks, Vol. 14, No. 6, November 2003 pp 1569-1572

EM Izhikevich "Which model to use for cortical spiking neurons?"  IEEE
Transactions On Neural Networks, Vol. 15, No. 5, 2004 pp 1063-1070

This single parameterization was used in these 2 papers with different
cell-sets being represented, although with some overlap.  We have
separately replicated the cell-sets from each paper.

** solves the following equations:

 v' = e*v^2 + f*v + g - u + I;    RESET if (v>30) v=c
 u' = a*(b*v-u);                  RESET if (v>30) u=u+d
(note that vv is used in for voltage in izhi2003a.mod so doesn't
interfere with built-in v of cell -- the built-in v is used for
izhi2003b.mod)


** a,b,c,d,I are the major parameters; 
f,g are reset for 2 simulations (G-"Class 1" and L-"integrator")

3 of the simulations shown in izhi2004.gif are not properly replicated:
Q: depolarizing afterpotential does not repolarize properly
R: accomodation requires an alteration of the functional forms to replicate
   (alternate functional form given on line 52 of izh.mod)
T: too unstable for Neuron integrators to handle
   (changing izh.hoc line 203 to Isend1(50,75) will crash simulator)

* 2007 Models description: 

Equations and parameter values taken from: Izhikevich EM
(2007). "Dynamical systems in neuroscience" MIT Press
Equation for synaptic inputs built-in for izhi2007.mod were taken
 from: Izhikevich EM, Edelman GM (2008). "Large-scale model of
 mammalian thalamocortical systems" PNAS 105 3593-3598.
(Note that this 2008 model is a multicompartmental model that we do
not replicate here so we are using 2007 model with 2008 synapses.)

** solves the following equations:
v' = v + (k*(v-vr)*(v-vt) - u - I)/C;  
u' = u + (a*(b*(v-vr)-u); 

RESET if v > vpeak: v = c ; u = u + d
(note that additional resets are used for particular models -- ie the
simulation is displaced in the phase plane to produce interruption and
create next stage of dynamics; see below)

** The following parameters specific to each cell type: C, k, vr, vt,
   vpeak, a, b, c, d and celltype

Cell types available are based on Izhikevich, 2007 book (chapter
8). Here we include a description of each cell type, the model
parameters required to implement it, and the conditions to replicate

    	-1200 pA; T = 650 ms; IinRange = [0,50,100] pA

    7. RTN - Rat reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) cell (fig 8.32 from

Note: The LTS, FS, TC and RTN cells require modifications to the
general equations -- additional resets on phase plane.
See the matlab (izhi2007.m) or the Python/Neuron (izhi2007.mod) for
details. For a full description see chapter 8 of Izhikevich, 2007.

* GUI for exploring parameters
python -i izhiGUI.py
Sets up menu to choose among 6 models using 2 different
parameterizations (2003/4 vs 2007) with 3 parameter sets illustrating
different cell dynamics (2003, 2004, 2007) and different
implementation types (voltage in a section vs both u,v calculated in
the mod file).

Each choice brings up a menu of all parameter settings as well as a
menu of standard choices based on cell types.

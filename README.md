# Memory Module: Hippocampus Neural Network Simulation
======
This is a project which simulates selected charactoristics of rat hippocampus neural activity.  I am developing it in CARLSim with GPU computing.

The main project file is in the base directory and named ./main_mem_mod_gpu.cpp .

Please see a more descriptive explanation of this project [located here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nmsutton/MemoryModule/blob/master/memory_module.ipynb).

Development log is [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nmsutton/MemoryModule/blob/master/dev_log.ipynb).

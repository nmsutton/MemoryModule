For example for a 0.5 ratio the initial layer caused spiking in 50% of the second layer's synapses.  It was designated that mainly the only spiking in layers was triggered from the synapses connected to them, layers had very little spiking due to an external current except for the first one.\n",

For example a ratio of 2.3 causes synapses to fire in the later layer 100% for a 0ms delay, 100% for a 5ms delay, and 30% for a 10ms delay."
